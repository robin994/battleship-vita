/**
 * frame_interpolation.h — Enhanced framerate mode (interpolated rendering).
 *
 * Renders k subframes per 60 Hz game tick (k = target fps / 60) with object
 * and camera matrices interpolated between the two most recent ticks. Game
 * logic cadence is untouched: PortPushFrame still runs exactly one tick, and
 * the tick's 16.67 ms wall duration is preserved because each of the k
 * subframe presents paces at 1/(60k) s via Fast3dWindow::SetTargetFps(60*k).
 *
 * Recording side: decomp draw code (gcPrepDObjMatrix, camera preps) calls
 * portInterpRecordMtx() at each gSPMatrix emission with the Mtx pointer and a
 * stable semantic key (owner object + ordinal). At drain time the port pairs
 * this tick's matrices against the previous drawn tick's by key and hands
 * per-subframe lerped values to Fast3D through the mtx_replacements map in
 * DrawAndRunGraphicsCommands. The final subframe uses an empty map, so the
 * landed frame is bit-exact game memory.
 *
